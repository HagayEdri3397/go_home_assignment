# Blink Take-Home Assignment

To get started simply run following commands:

```
$ go run .\main.go

There are 2 features:
1. Import a form (if you select the import form option again, the last one you chose to import will be selected)
2. Filling out the form you selected.
- If the form has options, you must choose only from the given options. You cannot enter another value(the user input convert to lower case. Pizza will convert to pizza)
### Good luck!!!
